Hello programmers and observers out there :

My name is Patrick and my goal is to design a tourist website centered on Mexico and starting off, on Mexico City. Mexico is not my place of birth, but it is my place of residence. I have lived in (not just visited) 4 different countries with 4 distinct languages :
the United States
France
Brazil
Mexico
As might be expected, my experience in each of these countries has been different. Each has a different social atmosphere, each country has different but at times similar themes that stand out and dominate in the country (e.g. the importance of learning English, hot sauce, dance, being 'alegre' (happy), holidays, properly speaking the language, and so on).
As an ex-pat Mexico is my preferred place of residence, Mexico is where I live, I do not want to live elsewhere (save maybe Argentina or Thailand). I believe that some day the United States will be the victim of a massive nuclear attack. For this reason and others, being an ex-pat makes a lot of sense for me. Mexico may not have the security that is said to exist in Tokyo or Paris, but still it is safer than some countries in this world that I've heard only about – South Africa, Pakistan, Honduras, Somalia, certain countries where Islam is the dominant religion – or lived in – the United States, Brazil.
That said Mexico is a beautiful country with a wealth of attractive tourist sites, beaches, pyramid ruins, museums, and so on. In 2019 45 million people came to Mexico making a contribution to Mexican income in tourist dollars. In 2021 because of the pandemic there were less, yet 32 million tourists is not a bad number (according to https://www.statista.com/). 
Given the touristic wealth, given the relative tolerance or acceptance of Mexicans towards westerners – which contrasts with countries such as France, Pakistan, Russia, the Netherlands, and numerous countries where Islam prevails – Mexico may not be exactly a paradise but it is as stated a preferable place to live. Putting up a website then is logical.
